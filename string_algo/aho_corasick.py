Constructs a trie out of the given pattern list. A trie is a tree data structure with
a single character on each edge. It is implemented using the Node class above. No node may 
have two edges coming from it both labelled with the same character, so patterns which
share a prefix also share an edge path equivalent to that prefix. Apart from its use in
the Aho-Corasick algorithm, constructing such a trie for a set of strings provides for
very efficient determination of membership in that set of strings.

Let the function lv(N) return the string formed by the concatenation of the characters
along the path from the root to node N. Given the root of a constructed pattern trie, 
link_pattern_trie adds failure and output links to all nodes in the trie. A node U's 
failure link is a reference to a second node V in the trie such that lv(V) is a suffix 
of lv(U), and furthermore is the longest suffix of U among all lv() values in the trie. 
A node U's output link is a reference to the first node ending a pattern that is encountered 
when iteratively following the path of failure links starting at U. If no such node ending 
a pattern exists, U's output link is None.

"""
Implementation of the Aho-Corasick multi-pattern string matching algorithm. Given a set
of patterns and a text T, this function will find all occurrences of the patterns in T
in O(n+m+k) time, where n is the summed length of the patterns, m is the length of T, and
k is the number of occurrences of the patterns in T. Aho-Corasick works by building a 
trie out of the patterns, then adding failure links to the trie as a generalization of
the failure function found in Knuth-Morris-Pratt. Output links are also added so that
patterns ending in different branches of the trie are not missed when matching.
